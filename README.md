Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

Please use the notebook on kaggle, else you might need to change the image directory to suite your usage. THANKS

Summary: There are 38 kind of diseases in the dataset of plants (apple, blueberry, cherry, corn, grape and etc). Using tensorflow to learn to do image classification to recognizing the disease.

Takeaway of the tutorial:

1) Using Tensorflow
2) Using imshow in matplotlib to show the img
3) Using Seaborn to plot the confusion matrix
4) Adjusting parameters (e.g. no. epochs, learning rate, dropout, adding convolutional layers) to improve the accuracy and reduce loss
